    ‚îÄ„Äå Why This Exists? „Äç‚îÄ
</h3>

Being an active telegram user and a person who don't like to use Whatsapp, but still wants to keep connected with friends.
A solution for the same would be using a bridge between both the apps. Yes, I know this already [exists](https://github.com/WhatsGram/WhatsGram), but unfortunately its not handling the group messages like what i was expecting. So I decided to create a similar one with multidevice support from [Tuhin's WhatApp userbot](https://github.com/tuhinpal/WhatsBot). In short you can call it as a fork of both [WhatsGram](https://github.com/WhatsGram/WhatsGram) and [WhatsBot](https://github.com/tuhinpal/WhatsBot). ~~I know , you know a better name , but still i love to call it as a fork. :/~~
